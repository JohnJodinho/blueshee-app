<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are tasked with generating JSON data that represents the structure of a `.docx` document titled "<Project Name> â€“ Basic RFP Bid Analysis". Replace <Project Name> with the name of the project (ensure it follows file naming conventions). This document will summarize essential project information as provided in the uploaded RFP. Each section should be formatted with clear headings and proper spacing for readability.
If user specifies the project name in <PROJECT_NAME> extract and use that name in the title. Otherwise, use the project name extracted from the RFP.

<FORMATTING GUIDELINES>
1. Title: Set the document title as "[Project Name] - RFP Analysis" using the project name extracted from the RFP.
2. Use the Blue_Sheet_Bid_Document_Template.pdf as a reference for formatting.
3. Use a header for each main section, with bold font for section names and sub-section names (e.g., "Bid Information:", "Funding Sources:").
4. Format content with appropriate spacing and alignment to ensure clarity.
5. Populate each field directly with extracted data from the RFP. If data is not available, label it as "Not specified".

<ACTION>

[{{"fileName": "<Project Name> - RFP Analysis.docx"}},
{{"type": "heading", "text": "<section title>", "fontSize": <font size>, "level": <heading level>}},
{{"type": "paragraph", "text": "<section content>", "fontSize": <font size>}},
...]

The sections are as follows:

1. Project Information:
   - Project Name
   - Location
   - Owner/Agency
   - Engineer or Consulting Firm (including contact information if available)

2. Bid Information:

   - List the funding source(s) provided in the RFP (Federal, State, Local, Private, Turnkey, P3, or Other)

4. Project Scope:
   - Summarize the project's scope of work as described in the RFP, including major components or requirements.

5. Contractual Information:
   - Job Completion Date
   - Bid Acceptance Period
   - Guarantee Percentage
   - Construction Schedule (working days)
   - Estimated Award Date

<INSTRUCTIONS>
Generate JSON output to create an Excel document draft based on the structure of "Blue Sheet Template 2024.csv". This JSON should represent the data for three separate worksheetsâ€”one each for MISCO, Shape, and Southwest Valve. Each worksheet should be structured as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row with key-value pairs for column headers and cell values.

<JSON SCHEMA>
Your JSON output should have the following structure:
{
    "document_name": "<Project Name> â€“ Bluesheet Draft.xlsx",
    "MISCO": [
        { "Spec Section": "...", "Equipment/Item Description": "...", "Named Manufacturers": "...", "Represented Company": "...", "Contact Information": "...", "Product Specifications": "..." },

}

<FORMATTING GUIDELINES>
1. Provide three worksheets with headers (e.g., Spec Section, Equipment/Item Description, Named Manufacturers, Represented Company, Contact Information, Product Specifications).
2. Each row should be formatted as a dictionary entry with the appropriate data extracted from the RFP.
3. For each worksheet (MISCO, Shape, Southwest Valve):
   - Include fields for spec sections, equipment descriptions, manufacturers, represented companies, and contacts.
   - Extract data based on relevance for each company, and if data is missing, label as "Not specified".
   - Example row for JSON entry:
      { "Spec Section": "33 40 00", "Equipment/Item Description": "Valve", "Named Manufacturers": "Brand A, Brand B", "Represented Company": "MISCO", "Contact Information": "Sandy Clarke, sclarke@miscowater.com", "Product Specifications": "Max pressure: 100 PSI" }

<INSTRUCTIONS>
Draft an email addressed to UFT portfolio company leads based on the bluesheet document generated in previous steps.

2. Start with a greeting, addressing UFT portfolio company leads directly (e.g., "Dear UFT Portfolio Company Leads").
3. Summarize the purpose of the email in a few sentences, highlighting that the email contains the bluesheet for the RFP analysis.
4. Briefly describe the contents of the bluesheet, mentioning key sections like project information, bid information, funding sources, equipment details, and synergy opportunities with MISCO, Shape, and Southwest Valve.
5. Conclude with a closing statement offering further assistance or requesting feedback if needed, followed by a professional signature (e.g., "Best regards, [Your Name]").
